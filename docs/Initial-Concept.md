# SharpTrace - Initial Concept

Welcome to the initial concept document for SharpTrace! This is where I’m laying out the early ideas and goals for this project. Things might evolve as development progresses, so consider this a starting point.

## Overview

SharpTrace aims to provide a way to trace and analyze the execution of legacy C# applications. It’s designed to help you see what’s happening in your code, measure performance, and understand how different parts of your software interact.

## Key Features

- **Execution Tracing**: Capture and log method calls, including their arguments and return values.
- **Timing Analysis**: Measure how long different parts of your code take to execute.
- **Legacy Focus**: Tailored for working with older C# codebases, making it easier to analyze and improve them.

## Goals

1. **Detailed Tracing**: Provide clear insights into method calls and execution flow.
2. **Performance Metrics**: Help identify performance bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
3. **Legacy Compatibility**: Make it easier to work with and understand older code.

## How It Works

SharpTrace will use various techniques to gather runtime information:

- **Method Interception**: Intercept method calls to capture arguments, return values, and execution times.
- **Data Collection**: Store tracing data in a structured format for later analysis.
- **Reporting**: Generate reports or visualizations to help you understand the collected data.

## Current Status

Right now, SharpTrace is in the setup phase. The basic infrastructure is being put in place, and early features are being developed. I’m working on getting the core functionality up and running, so check back for updates!

## Future Plans

- **Enhanced Features**: Adding more detailed tracing options and better performance metrics.
- **User Interface**: Developing a GUI for easier interaction and visualization.
- **Documentation**: Improving the documentation as features are added and refined.
