## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

SharpTrace is a tool I’m building to help dig into and understand old C# codebases. It traces the execution flow, times things, and captures method arguments, so you can see what’s going on under the hood of your legacy applications.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

This section will eventually walk you through how to get SharpTrace up and running. Right now, it’s still early days, so stay tuned for more details.

### Prerequisites

Before you dive in, make sure you’ve got the following:

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)
- C# extension for VSCode (if you’re using VSCode)

### Installing

Instructions for installing SharpTrace will be added once things are more stable. For now, just hang tight.

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

I’ll add some info on testing SharpTrace when there’s something to test. Unit tests, performance checks, and all that good stuff will be covered.

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

This is where I’ll explain how to actually use SharpTrace. Expect command examples, setup tips, and other useful stuff once the project is further along.

## 🚀 Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

Details on how to deploy SharpTrace will go here once I figure that out myself. Check back later!

## ⛏️ Built Using <a name = "built_using"></a>

This section will list the main tools and libraries used in SharpTrace, but that’s coming later. For now, just know it’s all about C#.

## ✍️ Authors <a name = "authors"></a>

- **[Niklas Ahlers]** - Just a solo dev putting this together. Reach out if you’ve got questions or ideas.

## 🎉 Acknowledgements <a name = "acknowledgement"></a>

Shoutouts will go here for any cool tools, tutorials, or people that help along the way. This will grow as the project does.

- **[ADD WHEN PERSON OK TO BE MENTIONED]** - Thanks for the idea of the project!!!

## License <a name = "license"></a>
